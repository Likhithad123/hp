<ul style="line-height:1.6">
--<li>Consider purchasing a reputable road-side assistance program.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the car owner’s manual on the proper procedure & warnings for changing a flat.</li>
<li>If your wheels have locking lug nuts, be sure to keep the key-lug where you can easily find it. You will need it to change the tire.</li>
<li>Remove the jack and wrench, assemble and practice operating it. If it is rusty, lubricate it.</li>
<li>Check occasionally to make sure that your spare tire has sufficient air pressure (PSI).</li>
<li>Store a couple of parking blocks in your trunk. Also store a roadside emergency kit in your trunk – most include a flashlight, tire sealant, tire inflator, reflective road markers, etc. These are inexpensive and can be purchased at any auto accessory store.</li>
<li>Rotating your tires at manufacturer's recommended intervals can prevent a common problem when changing a flat.</li>
<li>When loosening and tightening the nuts, arrange the cross wrench so that you are pressing down (with gravity). This will remove risk of injury to your back and also allow you to use your body weight rather than just your arm strength. Press on the end of the wrench for the best leverage. You can even use your foot, but make sure to keep your balance and steady yourself against the car.</li>
<li>When replacing nuts, be sure that the tapered side goes into the wheel. This centers the wheels and locks the nuts in place.</li>
<li>Sometimes the wheels will seize to the hub, resulting in great difficulty in removal of the flat tire. If this happens, you will need a sledgehammer and a 2x4 or other piece of wood to remove a seized wheel rim. Rotating your tires will prevent this from happening when you do have to change a tire.</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="text-align:center">WARNINGS</h1>
<div class="para" style="text-align:left;">
<p>
<ul style="line-height:1.6">
<li>For safety, place an object such as a log, large rock, etc., under the vehicle after jacking, but before removing the tire. Place it so that it will stop the vehicle from dropping in case the jack is dislodged or shifts for some reason while the wheel is removed.</li>
<li>Be aware of your surroundings. If you're on a busy road, be particularly wary of vehicles driving by that might get too close. There are hundreds of people killed each year while changing a tire on the side of the road; don't do this unless you must.</li>
<li>Never use cinder blocks or makeshift jacks. A car is very heavy and if you use anything else you are putting yourself and your car at risk</li>
<li>Don't get under the car when it's supported only by a jack. If you're planning on working under the car, place it on jack stands, or drive it up on ramps if the wheels don't need to be free.</li>
<li>Most spare tires (the undersized "donut" tires) are not designed for speeds of more than 50 mph (80 km/h) or for long distances. Exceeding this speed can cause problems, including failure of the spare tire. Instead, drive slowly and carefully to a shop and have your tire repaired or replaced.</li>
